it was the first time that the russian-built zarya control module and the made-in-america unity chamber had ever touched.
for the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle endeavour on friday for liftoff on nasa's first space station construction flight.
the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound zarya, a power and propulsion module that was launched from kazakstan on nov.
when the two pieces were aligned within inches of one another, cabana fired small thruster rockets that raised the shuttle, allowing the modules to clamp together.
