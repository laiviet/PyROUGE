with the threat of nato attack mounting, yugoslavia's prime minister warned monday the nation faces the imminent danger of war and claimed the government is taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in kosovo.
we hope to make clear to president milosevic and the people of yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation, holbrooke said after a meeting with nato leaders.
serbian police and the yugoslav army have routed separatist kosovo albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late february.
speaking after a meeting with nato secretary general javier solana and supreme allied commander europe wesley k. clark, holbrooke said while the level of fighting( in kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.
