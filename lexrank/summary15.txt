when the united states weighs in, however, is when the imf is called on to rescue a country in deep trouble.
central bank chairman viktor gerashchenko and finance minister mikhail zadornov flew to washington on friday for negotiations with the imf over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment.
what makes this year's imf meeting most remarkable, though, is that the harshest criticisms are directed at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the u.s.
though government officials say such a plan is only one of six possibilities, prime minister yevgeny primakov warned thursday that he might be forced to take unpopular measures to rescue the russian economy if it does not receive the next installment in a dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the international monetary fund.
