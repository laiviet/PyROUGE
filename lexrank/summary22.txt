prime minister benjamin netanyahu appointed ariel sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be israeli foreign minister on friday in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning over more west bank land to the palestinians.
with his appointment, sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for jewish settlements in the west bank, is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions that netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference in the washington area next week.
who is the right wing now if sharon is in the foreign ministry and negotiating with the palestinians?
