the hostages britons peter kennedy, darren hickey, and rudolf petschi, and new zealand's stanley shaw were engineers.
most hostages have been released unharmed, though dozens remain in captivity.
maskhadov said chechen officials had caught one of the captors monday and he told police where the hostages were being held.
his release came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were found in chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
we will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime, said maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in chechnya since being elected last year.
