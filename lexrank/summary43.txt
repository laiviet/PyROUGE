pitching to the yankees chuck knoblauch : hard throwers like to jam him with fastballs because he stands on top of the plate, which is why he gets hit so often.

with the count two balls and two strikes, langston threw a pitch near the outside corner that he thought should have been a strike.
when he lays off them, he is a much better hitter, and he did this in the last game of the cleveland series.
