north korea has said the underground construction is for civilian use and not nuclear-related.
we've made clear to the north koreans that any attempt by north korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development program would be unacceptable, the state department spokesman, james rubin, said.
president clinton made an unusual, direct appeal to north korea on saturday to set aside any nuclear ambitions in favor of strengthening ties to south korea and the united states.
the talks ended as clinton began a trip to asia that will include a visit to south korea, where the issue of the north korean construction site is expected to be among the major topics discussed with president kim dae-jung.
