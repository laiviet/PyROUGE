modern turkey has had only one islamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular traditions.
erez took over efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist bulent ecevit gave up, unable to convince turkey's bickering center-left and center-right parties to join him in a coalition that excluded the islamic-oriented party.
as long as our sensitivity toward the secular, democratic regime is taken into account, we will do our best to help form the new government and ensure it gets a vote of confidence, ecevit said after his own talks with erez.
