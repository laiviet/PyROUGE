2, malaysia's prime minister mahathir mohamad fired anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.
munawar ahmad aness, a friend and speech writer of anwar ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, allegedly confessing to having sex with the political dissident.
i may have been detained because i knew anwar during my involvement with the malaysian islamic youth movement, sidek was quoted as saying by the star daily.
given his control of the levers of power and the lack of focus or leadership in the opposition, mahathir could ride out the storm as anwar's trial proceeds.
