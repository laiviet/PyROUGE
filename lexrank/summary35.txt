prodi immediately offered his resignation to president oscar luigi scalfaro, who asked him to stay on as caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier.
prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the communists support.
officials in the prime minister's office said sunday night that prodi would meet on monday with president oskar luigi scalfaro to discuss the political turbulence, though not to offer his resignation.
he could ask prodi or someone else to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something most analysts think unlikely.
