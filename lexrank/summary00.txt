in the most recent elections, held in july, hun sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government.
the royalist party also rejected hun sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that ranariddh's main ally sam rainsy also be included.
funcinpec has demanded from hun sen written guarantees for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for re-entering negotiations.

after a series of border clashes, the khmer rouge was ousted from power by an invading vietnamese army that set up a surrogate cambodian communist government later led by hun sen.
