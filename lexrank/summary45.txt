the president and his doctors say yeltsin has no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years of his term.

yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during his visit to central asia on sunday and monday.
yeltsin has decided to send prime minister yevgeny primakov to the november summit of the asia-pacific economic forum in kuala lumpur because it deals mostly with financial issues, yeltsin's office said.
there will be no turmoil if yeltsin leaves the political arena.
there were no plans to hospitalize yeltsin, who arrived in moscow late monday night from almaty, kazakstan, a day earlier than planned.
