one of the government's allegations in the antitrust suit is that microsoft won out over netscape as the main browser for aol because microsoft used its windows monopoly as a bargaining chip.
now in the corridors outside the antitrust trial microsoft's lawyers maintain that netscape has found a new partner in america online and has no need of protection from the government.
most companies that sell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e-commerce space, said america online president robert pittman in a news conference tuesday.
sun microsystems, analysts say, could be a strong partner for aol in the market for internet commerce software.
