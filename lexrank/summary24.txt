the airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the wye river land-for-security deal between israel and the palestinians.
israeli airport security officials were not available for comment.
the airfield will also make it easier for palestinians to travel abroad, although a majority of gazans are probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket.
israel's government does not permit israelis to use the palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
in one corner of the airfield, about 300 people gathered around a man and a boy riding mules that moved to the beat of drums.
