because the republicans now control the house by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against gingrich to deny him a majority.
but gingrich's leadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the speaker's office, he is in danger of marginalization.

i hope that whoever succeeds newt gingrich as speaker will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was wrought on this institution over the last four years, gephardt said.
