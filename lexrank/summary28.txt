i must set the example that i hope president clinton will follow, livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond.
thursday night, livingston stated that he would not be intimidated by these efforts to exploit his past.
the democrats made the opposite point, arguing that the livingston case showed how very wrong it was to savage people for personal pecaddillos.
livingston stood in the well of the house he has served for two decades and called on clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the senate, drawing boos from his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit instead.
