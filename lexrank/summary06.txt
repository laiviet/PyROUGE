prime minister mahathir mohamad fired anwar in september, saying he was morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from malaysia's ruling party.
now, though, mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund economy.
foreign investors have also not wholly abandoned malaysia, as experts had predicted they would.
worse still, asia's economic crisis is showing signs of going global, and more and more economists are criticizing the imf for the way it is handling its bailouts.
