on wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in an open letter that the government release xu, qin and wang youcai, saying the arrests run counter to u.n.
a third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, xu wenli, has been detained for weeks in beijing and is expected to face similar subversion charges.
wang was a student leader in the 1989 tiananmen square democracy demonstrations.
china signed the international covenant of civil and political rights with great fanfare in october, and xu's arrest is seen by human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment to its tenets.
