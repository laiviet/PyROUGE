israel, for its part, said it does not want to become involved in any military confrontation between syria and turkey.
egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation over turkish allegations that syria is harboring turkish kurdish rebels.
the turkish daily milliyet speculated sunday that turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the syrian-controlled bekaa valley of eastern lebanon, where turkey says rebels of abdullah ocalan's kurdish workers party, or pkk, maintain camps.
meanwhile, syria's assad received messages of support from saudi crown prince abdullah bin abdel-aziz and from the leaders of yemen and sudan, said syria's official news agency, sana.
