as part of the latest mideast peace accord, israeli and palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport friday and palestinian negotiators said gaza international airport would open sunday. palestinians living in the west bank still need a permit to cross israel into gaza to get to the airport. the airport opening had been held up for two years because of disputes between israel and the palestinian authority over israel's role in monitoring passengers and cargo. officials said palestinian leader yasser arafat may travel by car to egypt in order to fly into the airport.
