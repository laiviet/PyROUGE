and democrats on tuesday expressed concern over some white house positions, on issues like the census and an apparent compromise with republicans on aid for farmers. if republican leaders can not count on their conservatives, they will need support from democrats to pass the final package. for the first time in decades, congress and the white house negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus. democrats contend that now is the time to press the republicans, while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign.
