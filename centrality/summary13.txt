republicans were discussing possible challenges to gingrich, his second-in-command, rep. robert livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him running against newt gingrich as speaker. his supporters said gingrich had the votes to win the election to nominate a speaker, which is to be conducted by secret ballot. just two weeks ago, gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging from 10 seats to more than 40. and while gingrich has not gone out of his way to identify himself with the republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking president clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible.
