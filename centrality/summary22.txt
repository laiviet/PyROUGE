netanyahu then created a cabinet job, the minister of infrastructures, especially for sharon. ariel sharon's appointment as the israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the middle east peace process, an official syrian newspaper said saturday. many arabs know sharon for his role in israel's 1982 invasion of lebanon. who is the right wing now if sharon is in the foreign ministry and negotiating with the palestinians? that will be fine if sharon is willing to play a constructive role in the peace talks himself. i feel more safe about the negotiations if minister sharon is directly involved, said landau, who heads the parliament's security and foreign affairs committee.
