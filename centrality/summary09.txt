milosevic was apparently accusing holbrooke of supporting the ethnic albanian guerrillas of the kosovo liberation army, who have been fighting to make the serbian province of kosovo an independent nation. we hope to make clear to president milosevic and the people of yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation, holbrooke said after a meeting with nato leaders. the yugoslav army mined kosovo's borders with macedonia and albania, ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for the rebels. on sunday, human rights watch said both milosevic's government and ethnic albanian rebels have committed atrocities since the conflict began, but the government abuses were on a much greater scale.
