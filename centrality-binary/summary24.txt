as part of the latest mideast peace accord, israeli and palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport friday and palestinian negotiators said gaza international airport would open sunday. the palestinians, in turn, accuse israel of reneging on an agreement to release palestinians jailed for anti-israel activities.
 in the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some improvisation. taking a major step toward statehood, the palestinians on tuesday inaugurated gaza international airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.
